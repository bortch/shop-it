Given a melody in C major, e.g. Mary Had a Little Lamb

E D C D E E E, D D D, E G G

Determine all chord progressions that fit the melody:
- Maybe encode suspensions
- Maybe encode 7th as optional to avoid bloat?

Example:
CM G7 CM G7 CM CM CM, G7 G7 G7, G6 G7 CM

To handle different keys, could specify chords using scale degrees or in C major, then apply a transform to generate corresponding chords in other keys.
